            Hi there â€“ My name is Hannah and welcome to my photography portfolio page!
            <br/> <br/> 
            Photography has been a big part of my life over the last 3 years and has turned into a passion of mine. I enjoy creating beautiful photos that make people smile. 
            <br/> <br/> 
            My portfolio of work is growing and ranges from weddings to wildlife and everything in-between. Most of my experience lies within lifestyle photography, the natural light is my best friend and suits my editing style.
            <br/> <br/> 
            I would describe myself as an intermediate amateur photographer with a lot of drive to advance and create stunning pictures.
            <br/> <br/> 
            I also work alongside a close friend as a second photographer for her Wedding Photography business. If this is something you are interested in, then feel free to check out her page here. 
            <br/>
